This project contains the source code of the project 'Starbucks Menu Express' by Team Starbies. Our project is based on a popular global Coffee franchise, dearly known by its patrons as Starbucks. Keeping the customers at the forefront, we wish to make ordering coffee more convenient and cater to everyone‚Äôs dietary needs. Aim: ‚ÄúTo inspire and nurture the human spirit ‚Äì one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.‚Äù This mission reflects Starbucks‚Äô commitment to not only serving coffee but also creating a positive and inclusive environment to enjoy coffee and connect with others. In alignment with this aim for inclusivity, Starbucks also provides food items on its menu (apart from coffee).

An issue with the franchise is time consumed based on queries from customers regarding their dietary preferences and restrictions. Examples: Veganism, Lactose intolerance, Diabetes, and Food allergies.

Our software aids in eliminating time spent in ordering. With our software, customers can make informed decisions before even reaching the cash register or order fully online. User enters his/her preferences, and our system filters what doesn‚Äôt apply.

Special instructions: Executing this project requires Node.js. First, you have to open Command prompt. Navigate to the folder containing the source code. Run the command npm install. If successful, you will see a message about up to date, Audited x packages, found 0 vulnerabilities. Then run npm start from any IDE.

On the any of the compatible browsers mentioned in our SRS, run localhost:portnumber

Normally the result of running npm start will provide the portnumber, for instance, 3000.

Following the steps correctly, will load the landing page. The software also connects to an external api (backend).

Site: dashboard.stripe.com primarily used to see order history from a user's account.
